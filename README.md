# Gamers Library
Gamers Library is a complete website with a database of games created for users to be able to share what games they have played with other gamers. The purpose of this is to allow users to not only view a library of games but also comment and like each game if they wish to, this allows the user to find like minded individuals, new games to play and to share their own experience with the games they've played.

## User Stories
One of the first things I did after deciding on what my project was to be able was to create some user stories to help figure out what functionality my website should have.

### As a User:
* As a Site User I can suggest a new game to be added so that I can share my favourite games with others.
* As a Site User I can view the games in the library so that I can find new games to play.
* As a Site User I can create an account so that I can interact with the site.
* As a User I can go to the next page so that I am not overwhelmed by content.
* As a Site User I can comment on games so that share my experience with that game to others.
* As a Site User I can like/unlike games so that I can interact with the content.
* As a Site User I can search using a filter so that I can find games similar to what I enjoy already.

### As an Admin:
* As a Site Admin I can approve game suggestions so that I can prevent games that don't exist from being added.
* As a Site Admin I can approve or delete comments so that the site remains a friendly environment.
* As a Site Admin I can create, read, update and delete games so that I can prevent duplicate games being added and remove games if necessary.

## Wireframes
Before I started any of the coding I first created some wireframes for how I envisioned the project to look.

* For the home page I've gone with a relatively empty idea to prevent the user from being overwhelmed with information.

* For the library page I'm aiming to create a page that shows only a few game posts with pagination to help prevent an overload of information.

* The add game page is going to consist of a simple form that only shows once the user has logged in.

![Add Game Wireframe](documentation/wireframes/add-game-wireframe.png)

* The login page will look similar to every other login page with an option for those without an account to register.
