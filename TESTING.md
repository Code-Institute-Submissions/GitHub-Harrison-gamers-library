# Gamers Library Testing
Return back to the [README.md](README.md)

The testing process has been broken into two sections; one from a users point of view which focuses on how they might interact on the site and the other from an admins point of view and how they might check the site is function as expected.

## User Focused Testing
This section consists of all testing done regarding the users features and how a user might interact on the site.

### User Story Testing
Testing user stories required me to take a user first approach to the website and think solely about what a user would want to be able to do while on the site. Below are the user stories I Testing for:

* Account Creation
* Viewing the Library
* Adding a Game
* Commenting
* Pagination

## Admin Focused Testing
This section focuses more on how an admin might interact with the site and what features they might use.

### Admin User Story Testing
Testing admin user stories required me to look at the site solely as an admin and to focus more on the admin page rather than the actual site. Below are the stories I tested for:

* Moderating the library
* Approving new games
* Approving/Removing comments

## Feature/Function Testing
I have manually tested this project by doing the following:
* Passed the code through different validators
* Testing all navigation and links work as intended
* Testing the user can submit a new game to be added
* Testing the user can create an account
* Testing the user can freely login/logout
* Testing the user can view the library
* Testing the pagination works correctly
* Testing the image carousel works correctly
* Testing each game has its own post detail page
* Testing the user can post comments on each games detail page
* Testing the admins can approve both games and comments

I also created a few tests within the project to help automate some of the process.
